Another project done.

I have no clue if i'm going to quiclky adapt to the world of programming.
These projects I've been doing are all too strictly guided and I feel like I'm just copying and pasting the whole 130'ish minute videos.

Maybe in the near future there will be new opportunities to improve by doing it all by myself.

I've always learnt better when I just did it all from zero. The classes were obliged but the real knowledge I obtained as I took risks and commited (wow) to the novelty.

And it is always coming towards us.
